# EVENT DETAILS

## IDEAS & TEAMS

Coming up with the perfect hack might be the hardest part of the event, and can eat into your time quickly. We encourage hackers to put some thought into an idea before the event so you can spend as much time as possible hacking away! Possible sources of inspiration will be,

- Product areas you have worked in previously.
- Software or code bases you play with outside of work.
- Day to day problems that might need solving.
  Forming teams, like event ideas, are encouraged to be organised before the event if possible. The largest team size we recommend is five people. This is not a hard rule but larger teams will spend more time collaborating and less time coding, which might not turn out so well when trying to bring ideas to fruition. Of course there is nothing stopping you from having a team size of one if you want to go solo on your awesome hackathon plan! Teams can also be formed across different offices if you wish, there are no geographical limits here!

## PRESENTATIONS & PRIZES

Presentations are the summation of the CSGHack event. You have the opportunity to get up in front of your fellow hackers and show off the hacking you got done! To keep the presentations timely there will be a hard 3min timeline with a buzzer sounding at 2min 30sec so you know when time is almost up! So bring your code, story boards, plans, outfits and anything else you think will help you share your idea!

What's up for grabs? Prizes for the winners of each category, bragging rights, your photo in the Hall of Fame and a pretty sweet trophy!

CSGHack uses category themes to help hackers strive for specific goals or even just personalize their hack. The event will be held with 2 themes,

- Best product hack - keep product or internal tools in mind.
- Most creative hack - Be innovative - think outside the box.

The winners from each office will have the opportunity to present their hacks to a group of leaders and Product Management.

## JUDGING & VOTING

Voting will commence straight after presentations conclude, this is a peer voted event.
